    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Changing weather patterns worldwide or across regions are termed climate change. Climate change is often understood to refer to the rise in global temperatures beginning in the mid-20th century. People who study Earth have noticed that Earth's climate is getting warmer. Earth's temperature has gone up about two degree Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. This may not seem like much. But small changes in Earth's temperature can have big effects. Some effects are already happening. Warming of Earth's climate has caused some snow and ice to melt, oceans to rise and it has also changed the timing of when certain plants grow.</p>
