    <h1>CODE RED FOR CLIMATE</h1>
    <h2> Take a closer look at our planet's climate change.</h2>
    <p>Climate change refers to the change in the environmental conditions of the earth. This happens due to many internal and external factors. The climatic change has become a global concern over the last few decades. Besides, these climatic changes affect life on the earth in various ways. These climatic changes are having various impacts on the ecosystem and ecology. Due to these changes, a number of species of plants and animals have gone extinct.</p>

    <section class="causes">
      <h2>Reasons</h2>
      <p>Here are some reasons due to which climate change is caused-</p>

          <h3>Intensive Agriculture</h3>
          <p class = "point"><img src = "assets/agriculture.jpg" alt="Picture of agricultural farming">Planting crops and rearing animals releases many different types of greenhouse gases into the air. For example, animals produce methane, which is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. The nitrous oxide used for fertilisers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.</p>

          <h3>Deforestation</h3>
          <p class = "point"><img src = "assets/deforestation.jpg" alt="Picture of burning trees">Forests remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Cutting them down means that carbon dioxide builds up quicker since there are no trees to absorb it. Not only that, trees release the carbon they stored when we burn them.</p>
